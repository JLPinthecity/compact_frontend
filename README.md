# Compact

Compact is a gear list planner built for thru-hikers and backpackers. Use Compact to calculate your pack's final weight and track details about individual items. The front end was built using React and Redux with a Rails API backend. The backend repo can be found [here](https://github.com/JLPinthecity/compact_backend).
